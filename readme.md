### Webinar Overview

In the digital age, data is abundant, yet there remains a stark disparity between its availability and its utilisation. This hurdle often arises from the technical complexities involved in querying databases. Our webinar aims to shed light on this issue by demonstrating how Large Language Models (LLMs) can skillfully translate natural language into Structured Query Language (SQL), with a focus on Netflix Movie Data.

The session will delve into significant advancements in this arena, paying special attention to the Yale Spider challenge. What's more, attendees will be treated to a live coding session, employing resources that can be accessed via GitHub.

This session is ideal for business professionals who wish to harness the power of data without the steep learning curve of SQL, as well as AI enthusiasts with a zeal for natural language processing applications. Let's navigate the interface between natural language and data querying together, unlocking the extensive capabilities of LLMs in both your professional and personal ventures.
